    "- Hidden Markov model is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process — call it X — with unobservable (\"hidden\") states. As part of the definition, HMM requires that there be an observable process Y whose outcomes are \"influenced\" by the outcomes of X in a known way. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since X cannot be observed directly, the goal is to learn about X by observing Y.\n",
    "  HMM has an additional requirement that the outcome of Y at time {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}}{\\displaystyle t=t_{0}}    must be \"influenced\" exclusively by the outcome of X at: \n",

    "- Given a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), we want to calculate the probability of a state at a certain time, given some evidence via some sequence of emissions. Let us assume the following [HMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) as described in Chapter 9.2 of Manning and Schütze (1999)"
